# Recommended Installation Depth of Seawater Intrusion Sensors Derived from Monitoring Data and Analytical Solutions

Multi-parameter sensors will be installed for the project MEDSAL. This note describes a rationale to identify the optimal installation depth. Three recommendations are given depending on data availability.

## Objectives

The selection of the depth of installation to monitor groundwater salinization aims at targeting the transition zone between freshwater and saltwater. The best result is expected when the sensor for electric conductivity and other physical or chemical parameters is located directly at the beginning of the transition zone.

There are two ways for estimating the depth of the interface. The best and most straightforward way for estimating the depth of installation is by measuring a depth profile of electric conductivity or salinity or chloride concentration or TDS. The depth of the transition zone can also be estimated using analytical solutions of the flow equation with two density liquids (freshwater and saltwater).
